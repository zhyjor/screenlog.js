=====
*Bring console.log, on the screen*
***

Ever faced a situation where you said "Why doesn't this bug show up when developer console is open!!"? And since the bug doesn't show when you have console open, you cannot do debug logging using `console.log`.

Enter `screenlog.js`. `screenlog.js` brings the developer console right on your screen so that you can do logging without having the developer console open always.
